# ExcelApplication
Step 1: After turning on the application, upload the xml file 
Step 2: After uploading the file, we can create a report from the DataGridView and save it to disk 
Step 3: Then we can upload the excel file to the application again and search with commands, for example: status = '1'



*Unfortunately, I was unable to edit the files in the application and overwrite the changes made there. Another disadvantage is also the lack of a second sheet.
